The Custom SSH Login Banner Add-on displays a custom banner to all users who log in to your Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; deployment through SSH. Operators can use the add-on to comply with organizational regulations.

This topic describes how to set up the Custom SSH Login Banner Add-on by creating a manifest and installing the software binary.

## <a id="prereqs"></a> Prerequisites

Verify that you have satisfied the following prerequisites:

* PCF operator administration rights
* BOSH deployed through Ops Manager 1.7 or later

## <a id="manifest"></a> Create the Manifest

Follow these steps to create the Custom SSH Login Banner manifest for your deployment:

1. Create a manifest file `custom-ssh-login-banner-addon.yml` starting with the code below as a template.

      ```
      releases:
      - name: os-conf
        version: 3

      addons:
      - name: misc
        jobs:
        - name: login_banner
          release: os-conf
        properties:
          login_banner:
            text: |
              This computer system is for authorized use only. All activity is logged and regularly checked by system administrators. 
              Individuals attempting to connect to, port-scan, deface, hack, or otherwise interfere with any services on this system will be reported.
      ```

1. Under the `login_banner: - text` property, specify the text to display as a custom SSH login banner.

## <a id="deploy"></a> Download and Deploy the Binary

1. Download the Custom SSH Login Banner Add-on software binary from the Pivotal Network to your local machine.

1. Copy the software binary to your Ops Manager instance.
<pre class="terminal">
$ scp -i PATH/TO/PRIVATE/KEY custom-ssh-login-banner-release.tar.gz ubuntu@YOUR-OPS-MANAGER-VM-IP:
</pre>

1. Copy the Custom SSH Login Banner manifest file to your Ops Manager instance.
<pre class="terminal">
$ scp -i PATH/TO/PRIVATE/KEY custom-ssh-login-banner-addon.yml ubuntu@YOUR-OPS-MANAGER-VM-IP:
</pre>

1. SSH into Ops Manager.
<pre class="terminal">
$ ssh -i PATH-TO-PRIVATE-KEY ubuntu@YOUR-OPS-MANAGER-VM-IP
</pre>

1. Navigate to the software binary location in your working directory.
<pre class="terminal">
$ cd PATH-TO-BINARY
</pre>

1. Target your BOSH director instance with BOSH.
<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh target YOUR-OPS-MANAGER-DIRECTOR-IP 
Target set to 'Ops Manager'
Your username: director

</pre>

1. Upload your release.
<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh upload release PATH-TO-BINARY/BINARY-NAME.tar
